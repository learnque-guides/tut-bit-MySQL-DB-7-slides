# Window functions

A window function is a function that, for each row, computes a scalar result value based on a calculation against a subset of the rows from the underlying query.

MySQL supports window functions that, for each row from a query, perform a calculation using rows related to that row.

Let's look at MySQL examples:

[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/window-functions-usage.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/window-functions-usage.html)

```sql
SELECT empid, ordermonth, val,
  SUM(val) OVER(PARTITION BY empid
                ORDER BY ordermonth) AS runval
FROM EmpOrders;
```

```sql
SELECT empid, ordermonth, val, SUM(val), AVG(val)
FROM EmpOrders
GROUP BY empid, ordermonth, val
ORDER BY ordermonth;
```

One of the great advantages of window functions is that they donâ€™t hide the detail. This means you can write expressions that mix detail and aggregates. The next example demonstrates this:

```sql
SELECT orderid, custid, val,
  100 * val / SUM(val) OVER() AS pctall,
  100 * val / SUM(val) OVER(PARTITION BY custid) AS pctcust
FROM OrderValues;
```

Other example:

```sql
SELECT
         orderdate,
            freight,
         ROW_NUMBER()   OVER(PARTITION BY YEAR(orderdate)) AS 'row_number',
         SUM(freight)   OVER(PARTITION BY YEAR(orderdate)) AS 'total_freight_for_order_year'
       FROM Orders
ORDER BY orderdate;
```
