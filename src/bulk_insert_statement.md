# Loading Data from Comma-Delimited Files

You use the *LOAD DATA INFILE* statement to insert into an existing table data originating from a file. 

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'some_file.csv' INTO TABLE some_table
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY ';';
```

* Create a simple Car table with type column as varchar, number column as varchar
* Create file cars.txt with conext like:

```
skoda,rlt111
toyouta,mnt233
honda,mrt123
```
* Upload data to your created table


Note: By default, MySQL doesnâ€™t let you load any data using the LOAD DATA INFILE command. The behavior is controlled by the secure_file_priv system variable. 

You need to put this file in:

```sql
SELECT @@secure_file_priv;
```
